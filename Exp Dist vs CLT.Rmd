Synopsis
--------
This document investigates the exponential distribution in R and compares it with Central Limit Theorem. The distribution of averages of 40 exponentials will be evaluated. The distribution of averages looks far more Gaussian than the original exponential distribution.

```{r}
expo <- rexp(1000, rate = 0.2)
hist(expo)

expo_mean <- mean(expo)
expo_var <- var(expo)
```
Theoritical Mean of exponential distribution : `r round(expo_mean,2)`  
Theoritical variance of distribution : `r round(expo_var,2)`  

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(rexp(40)))
hist(mns)

avg_mean <- mean(mns)
avg_var <- var(mns)

```
Sample Mean of exponential distribution : `r round(expo_mean,2)`  
Sample variance of distribution : `r round(expo_var,2)`

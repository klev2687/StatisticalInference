Synopsis
--------
This document investigates the exponential distribution in R and compares it with Central Limit Theorem. The distribution of averages of 40 exponentials will be evaluated. The distribution of averages looks far more Gaussian than the original exponential distribution.

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(rexp(40, rate = 0.2)))
hist(mns)

avg_mean <- mean(mns)
avg_var <- var(mns)

```
Sample Mean of exponential distribution : `r round(avg_mean,3)`  
Theoritical Mean of exponential distribution : `r 1/0.2`  

Theoritical variance of distribution : `r (1/0.2)^2/40`  
Sample variance of distribution : `r round(avg_var,3)`  

Checking for normality
```{r}
qqnorm(mns)
qqline(mns)
```
